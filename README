A library for context free art in Ruby-Processing.

HOW TO:
For now, check out the samples.

TO DO:
* Make the drawings run in a separate thread so you can watch 'em go.
* Determine if we can run the rules iteratively without needing to parse them.
* Settle on a more compact vocabulary of options (although not as cryptic
  as ContextFree.app's).
* Comment the examples with helpful pointers.
* Write a real README.
* Stick up a GitHub wiki that's just a page full of images of all the examples.
* Try some neat integrations of context_free + control_panel.
